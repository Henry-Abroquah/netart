<p>In a far away land on a sea shore in the middle ofthe ocean. There was a young man who wrote poems. 
He goes to the seashore everyday to tell poems everyday. One day a passer by heard him reciting a poem.
In His eye she was a wandering female who was visiting the island of self. She appeared like a distant dream, one
I searched for, yet unseen. Lost in shadows, I couldn't find, Now she's here, I'm left behind. It was a dark night, 
moonlight bright, A boat on the ocean, like a wanderer in flight, Who had been found and seemed to find, 
what they were searching for, in their mind. Now who am I?
 She heard him telling his story about himself and extra. This is how it Went.</p>

<em></em>In the mirror's gaze, "who are you?" they inquire, A young black man, whose soul's set afire,
Skin kissed by the moon, ablaze at dawn's rise, 
Creativity and sports once filled my skies.
Dreams of millions once steered my life's quest,
Now self-evolution fuels my journey's behest.</em><br>

<strong>I'm a creative young man," I declare,
  From beyond this world, a parallel, I share.
  <p>A seeker of self, my past and fate," Hey, who is there?" I call out to the gate.</p>
  </ul>
  <li>"it's me, I'm Bright," </li>
    <li>echoes my inner drum,</li> 
   </li> Illuminating the path to who I'm to become.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Beyond this universe, my origins unknown, A traveler of realms, through dimensions I've flown.
    Seeking truths untold, in the cosmic expanse, I forge my identity , in this cosmic dance.</p>

    <o1>
      <li>A christian spirit, guided by the divine way</li>
      <li> Illuminating my path, in the light of each new day</li>
      <li>Im the truth</li>
    </o1>

    <hr>

    <p> That young man she saw was me, She looked into my eye, and I said:
      "In your eyes, you are a truly priceless treasure. 
      I have walked through thousands of mountains and rivers, yet I cannot step into your heart."
    </p>



    <p>For the rest of my life the wind and snow will be there, and you will be the plain. It is you who is gentle in my
      heart, and you are the one I look to. Those who are close to bitterness are red, but those who are close to you are
      sweet. </p>
